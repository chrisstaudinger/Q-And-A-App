// What is React?
// Can someone provide a fairy detailed overview of what React is? ü§î
// React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded

// Why is Testing Important?
// People are always talking about TDD. What's all the fuss about?
// Code testing is important because it helps you find bugs easily.
// Even the methods that look like the most simple ones sometimes don‚Äôt work beacuse of an annoying little bug.
// Imagine that you have a system with hundreds of methods, and suddenly a bug appears.
// Now you need to track it‚Äôs origin and fix it.
// This might take a while‚Ä¶Code testing, and unit testing in particular - are meant to prevent this exact problem.

// Are class components in React going to become deprecated now that there are context and hooks APIs?
// Good question. It will be interesting to see how it plays out. Bit too early to tell at this point.

// What is Docker?
// Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package

// Should I build my application using GraphQL or RESTAPI?

// What is Apollo?

// Should I use redux or context in my App?
// I am building a weather api, would it be better to use redux or context and hooks?

// Can someone explain Mocking with Jest?

// How does authenitication work?
// If someone can provide a simplistic overview would be great üôè

// Passport or Auth0?
// For javascript side-projects, do people prefer Passport or Auth0?

// What is a 418 HTTP Status Code?
